# Description

This script is contains my solutions to the optimization homework problems from my scientific computing class.

* The first problem deals with finding the maximum displacement of a mass attached to a spring using fminbnd(), golden section search, and Newton's method.
* The second problem deals with finding the minimum of a multivariable function using fminsearch() and gradient descent using the optimal "tmin" value
* The third problem minimizes the same multivariable function as problem 2 but uses different fixed step sizes (t) instead of the optimal (minimum) t-value
