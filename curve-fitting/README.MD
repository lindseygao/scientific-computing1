# Description

This repo demostrates the curve fitting skills I learned in my scientific computing class. There are polynomial, linear, exponential, and exponential + oscillating fits from real world data. Data collected range from Seattle population data, and CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheric data measured at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii.
